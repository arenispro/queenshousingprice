### INTRODUCTION
This project investigates the relationship between the occurrence of crime and the housing price in different areas of Queens. Generally, a safe neighborhood with lower crime rate would have higher property value. The dataset includes larceny, burgalry, assulault and sexual harrassment crime rate for each zipcode in Queens. We will explore which kind of crime has a greater effect on the sale price of a house. We will also use neighborhood information to make choropleth graphs to illustrate the sale price in Queens county as a whole.
